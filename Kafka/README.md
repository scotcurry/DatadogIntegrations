# Overview

Steps to get a Kafka lab environment up and running.  Should also have a producer and consumer application for testing.  This lab was built on Ubuntu Server 22.04.3 LTS

## Zookeeper Setup
**Note** There is a section in the Kafka setup about adding the commands to the zookeeper.properties file.  Don't do that in this section.

Requirements
- openjdk (sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless)
- zookeeper (sudo apt-get install zookeeperd)
    - validate zookeeper is running
        - telnet localhost 2181
        - type ruok, this should return imok and terminate the connection

## Kafka Setup

- create a service user for Kafka
    - sudo adduser kafka
- add the kafka user to the sudo group
    - sudo adduser kafka sudo
- login with the kafka user
    - su -l kafka

- create a downloads directory (Downloads) and get download kafka to it
    - wget https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.5.1/kafka_2.13-3.5.1.tgz (latest version https://kafka.apache.org/downloads)
- validate download
    - shasum -a 512 kafka_2.13-3.5.1.tgz (https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.5.1/kafka_2.13-3.5.1.tgz.sha512). Latest linked from downloads link.

- make a kafka directory and change to it (mkdir ~/kafka && cd ~/kafka)
- unzip the kafka binaries to the folder
   - tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/kafka_2.13-3.5.1.tgz --strip 1

- update the zookeeper configuration (~/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties)
    - vim zookeeper.properties insert (4lw.commands.whitelist=ruok, srvr, stat, mntr)

- update the server configuration file (~/kafka/config/server.properties) so you can delete topics
    - vim server.properties insert (delete.topic.enable = true)
    - vim server.properties (uncomment out listeners line)

## Configure the service startup files

### zookeeper.service (in /lib/systemd/service)
```
[Unit]
Requires=network.target remote-fs.target
After=network.target remote-fs.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=kafka
ExecStart=/home/kafka/kafka/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh /home/kafka/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties
ExecStop=/home/kafka/kafka/bin/zookeeper-server-stop.sh
Restart=on-abnormal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### kafka.service (in /lib/systemd/service)
```
[Unit]
Requires=zookeeper.service
After=zookeeper.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=kafka
Environment=JMX_PORT=9999
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/home/kafka/kafka/bin/kafka-server-start.sh /home/kafka/kafka/config/server.properties > /home/kafka/kafka/logs/kafka-start.log 2>&1'
ExecStop=/home/kafka/kafka/bin/kafka-server-stop.sh
Restart=on-abnormal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Make sure both services start every time the system boots
sudo systemctl enable zookeeper  
sudo systemctl enable kafka

## Test the Producer and Consumer
**Note** Make sure you are logged in with kafka user (su -l kafka)
### Create a Topic
```
~/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092  --topic CurrywareTopic
```
### Add an entry into the topic
```
echo "Hello, Scot" | ~/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic CurrywareTopic > /dev/null
```
### Retrive the entries
```
~/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic CurrywareTopic --from-beginning
```
**Note** If you get NO_LEADER_AVAILABLE you probably didn't uncomment out the listener port.

### Make sure connections can be made from non-localhost machines.
Edit the server.properties file and update the listner line to use the host name
```
listeners=PLAINTEXT://ubuntu-postgres.curryware.org:9092
```


## Troubleshooting - Kafka Setup
- **NOTE:** Look in the Kafka logs folder.  Ran into an issue where the server.log file in the logs folder said "Cluster ID doesnâ€™t match stored clusterId in meta.properties."  That value is stored in the log folder defined in the kafka services file (**NOT LOGS**) folder.  Rather than replace the clusterID value in the meta.properties file just delete the line.  When the server restarted Kafka was working.
- Ran into an issue where I was trying to change the port in the service startup section and zookeeper stopped working.  Copied the code from above and zookeeper was working, but I got an error on the ruok statement and it says the command isn't on the whitelist.
- To get zookeeper working again I add the statement 4lw.commands.whitelist=* to the zookeeper.properties file.

## Troubleshooting Datadog Commands
**List All JMX Metrics**
sudo -u dd-agent -- datadog-agent jmx list everything
