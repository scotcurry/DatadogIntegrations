## Overview

[Fluentbit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual) is a sub-project of [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) used for logging.  All this project did was get a prototype working to show how to send logs to Datadog.  Configure Datadog as an output in the fluent-bit.conf file and mount it to the container.
